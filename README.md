## Prerequisites

## Application structure with TypeSpec

Considerations:

* Manage TypeSpec code generation:
    * Update build scripts to include TypeSpec generation
* Manage generated code:
    * Not checked into source control (up to customer - take as base line and modify - ship for production is locked down | or freeze all tooling/libraries and generate)
    * Linked from application code

### Where does TypeSpec fit in API development flow

#### What can TypeSpec provide (what is autogenerated)

Client library & Server middleware for APIs

* API authentication
* API services through middleware routes
* API interfaces

#### What is the developer responsible for

* API server build scripts
    * Timothy Guerin or Will Temple - JavaScript build questions
* API server boilerplate
* API server business logic (Azure integrations such as database)
* Tool chain compatibility
    * API management layer (API Management)
    * Generate documentation
* API server hosting (such as Azure Container Apps)



## Start a [TypeScript | .NET] api application

## Create a TypeSpec project

In a subdir, create:

* tspconfig.yaml
* main.tsp

??? Add shortcut for module reference in integration code

## Generate spec, server, and client

## Integrate generated code into api application

Use service interface to create service implementation.

## Integrate Azure database service into api application

Integrate Azure services into service implementation.

TBD - validate with engineer per language, make sure to include Mario

## Run api application locally

## Deploy application to Azure

* azd up

## Use application in browser

* Assumes Swagger UI or similar

## Integrate with toolchain

TBD - conceptual information, not practical

## Clean up resources

## Prerequisites

## Application structure with TypeSpec

Considerations:

* Manage TypeSpec code generation:
    * Update build scripts to include TypeSpec generation
* Manage generated code:
    * Not checked into source control
    * Linked from application code

### Where does TypeSpec fit in API development flow

#### What can TypeSpec provide (what is autogenerated)

ORM for APIs

* API authentication
* API services through middleware routes
* API interfaces

#### What is the developer responsible for

* API server build scripts 
* API server boilerplate
* API server business logic (Azure integrations such as database)
* API management layer (API Management)
* API server hosting (such as Azure Container Apps)

## Start a [TypeScript | .NET] api application

## Create a TypeSpec project

In a subdir, create:

* tspconfig.yaml
* main.tsp

## Generate spec, server, and client

## Integrate generated code into api application

Use service interface to create service implementation.

## Integrate Azure database service into api application

Integrate Azure services into service implementation.

## Run api application locally

## Deploy application to Azure

* azd up

## Use application in browser

* Assumes Swagger UI or similar

## Create front end application

## Integrate generated client into front end application

## Create API Management resource

## Integrate generated OpenAPI 3 into API management resource

## Clean up resources
